        Brendan Eich born July 4, 1961 is an American computer programmer and
        technology executive. He created the JavaScript programming language and
        co-founded the Mozilla project, the Mozilla Foundation, and the Mozilla
        Corporation. He served as the Mozilla Corporation's chief technical
        officer before he was appointed chief executive officer, but resigned
        shortly after his appointment due to controversy over his opposition to
        same-sex marriage. He subsequently became the CEO of Brave Software.
